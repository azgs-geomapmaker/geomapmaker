were formed by volcanic explosion or aerial expulsion from volcanic vent.

downslope commonly in chaotic flows; once deposited, hot fragments may compact under their own weight and 
weld together.
• Felsic-composition pyroclastic flows — Hot ash, pumice, and rock fragments erupted from volcano or 
caldera. Material moves downslope commonly in chaotic flows; once deposited, hot fragments may compact 
under their own weight and weld together. Because of their high-silica content and resulting high viscosity, 
parental magmas tend to erupt explosively. Includes rhyolite, dacite, trachyte, latite; rocks are commonly light-
colored.

Material moves downslope commonly in chaotic flows; once deposited, hot fragments may compact under 
their own weight and weld together. Parental magma commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as thick lava 
flows but also can generate strong explosive eruptions to form pyroclastic flows. Includes rocks that are, in 
color and mineral composition, intermediate between felsic and mafic rocks (for example, andesite).
• Mafic-composition pyroclastic flows — Hot ash, pumice, and rock fragments erupted from volcano. Material 
moves downslope commonly in chaotic flows; once deposited, hot fragments may compact under their own 
weight and weld together. Because of their low silica content and resulting low viscosity, parental magmas tend 
to erupt gently as lava flows rather than more forcefully as pyroclastic flows. Includes basalt; rocks are com-
monly dark-colored. 
• Air-fall tephra — Fragments of volcanic rock and lava, of various sizes, carried into air by explosions and by hot 
gases in eruption columns or lava fountains; known as tephra. As tephra falls to ground, with increasing distance

deposited at some distance from volcano is known as volcanic ash.
• Felsic-composition air-fall tephra — Fragments of volcanic rock and lava, of various sizes, carried into air by 
explosions and by hot gases in eruption columns or lava fountains; known as tephra. As tephra falls to ground, 
with increasing distance from volcano, average size of individual rock particles and thickness of resulting 
deposit decrease. Because of their high silica content and resulting high viscosity, felsic-composition magmas 
tend to erupt explosively, readily forming pumice and volcanic ash. Composed of light-colored rocks (for 
example, rhyolite, dacite, trachyte, latite). 
• Intermediate-composition air-fall tephra — Fragments of volcanic rock and lava, of various sizes, carried 
into the air by explosions and by hot gases in eruption columns or lava fountains; known as tephra. As tephra 
falls to ground, with increasing distance from volcano, average size of individual rock particles and thickness 
of resulting deposit decrease. Parental magma commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as thick lava flows but 
also can generate strong explosive eruptions to form pyroclastic flows. Includes rocks that are, in color and 
mineral composition, intermediate between felsic and mafic rocks (for example, andesite). 
• Mafic-composition air-fall tephra — Fragments of volcanic rock and lava, of various sizes, carried into the air by 
explosions and by hot gases in eruption columns or lava fountains; known as tephra. As tephra falls to ground, with 
increasing distance from volcano, average size of individual rock particles and thickness of resulting deposit decrease. 
Because of their low silica content and resulting low viscosity, parental magmas tend to erupt gently as lava flows, and 
so these deposits are uncommon. Includes basalt; rocks are commonly dark-colored. 
• Lava flows — Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidified bodies of rock that 
form when they cool. Composed generally of fine-grained, dark-colored rocks (for example, basalt), which tend to 
form extensive sheets that have generally low relief, except in vent areas where cinder cones or shield volcanoes 
may form. Includes basaltic shield volcanoes, which may become very large (for example, Hawaii).
• Felsic-composition lava flows — Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidi-
fied bodies of rock that form when they cool. Because of their high silica content and resulting high viscosity, 
parental magmas tend to erupt explosively, and so these deposits are uncommon. Includes fine-grained, light-
colored rock with rhyolitic, dacitic, trachytic, and latitic composition.
• Intermediate-composition lava flows — Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, 
solidified bodies of rock that form when they cool. Parental magma commonly erupts from stratovolcanoes as 
thick lava flows. Includes rocks that are, in color and in mineral composition, intermediate between felsic and 
mafic rocks (for example, andesite).
• Mafic-composition lava flows — Lateral, surficial outpourings of molten lava from vent or fissure; also, solidi-
fied bodies of rock that form when they cool. Low-silica parental magmas have low viscosity and tend to form 
extensive sheets that have generally low relief. Includes basaltic shield volcanoes, which may become very large 
(for example, in Hawaii). Composed of fine-grained, dark rocks, including basaltic.
• Volcanic mass flow — Volcanic deposits formed by mass movement (for example, debris avalanches, debris flows, 
lahar deposits), in many cases triggered by volcanic eruption. Debris avalanches that occur on volcanoes clearly 
without eruptive trigger may be classified as sedimentary (for example, as “Debris flows, landslides, and other local-
ized mass-movement sediment”).
